        <h2>The Science Behind Digital Toxicity</h2>
        <p>
          Studies show that prolonged exposure to negative digital content can lead to increased levels of cortisol, the stress hormone.
          It can also impact sleep quality, mood regulation, and overall mental well-being. Reducing toxicity consumption can lead to improved
          focus, better emotional resilience, and a more positive outlook on life.
